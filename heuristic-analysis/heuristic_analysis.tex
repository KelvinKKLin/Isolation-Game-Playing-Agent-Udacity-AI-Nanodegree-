\section{Introduction}
In this report, I will analyse the performance of each of the 3 evaluation heuristic functions I created for my Isolation Game Playing Agent and make recommendations as to what the next steps should be based on my findings.

My first evaluation function took a ratio between the number of moves my agent had left versus the number of moves the opponent's agent had.
